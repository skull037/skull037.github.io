You can move using WASD and shoot using arrow keys. The project uses P5.js for graphics and Sockets.io for connectivety. You can play the game<a href="">here</a></div>

  <div>Another project I have made is Tale of Zol, which is a Legend of Zelda like game. I created this as my final project in the 10th grade. It only uses Javascript, and all of the map data is in a array of objects. One issue is that the rooms are actually images so having a slow internet connection can have these take a while to load. You can move using WASD or arrows keys, and space bar attacks. You can play the game<a href="/Projects/ZOL/Index.html">here</a></div>
