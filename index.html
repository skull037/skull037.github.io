  <div>I am an AP and honors student at Pasadena High School. I am interested in robotics and programming, and I am on the school robotics team where I am a programmer.<!--put robotics picture--> Additionally I am in the App Acadamy, which is a prgoramming pathway where I have created several games that you can play here. Because of this pathway I can code in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Independently I also have experience in coding in C# for coding in Unity.</div>

  <img src="img/zombiespng.PNG" alt="zombie image">
  <div>Zombies squared is one such game, which was the last main project I created in 11th grade. You have to avoid pink and orange zombies while surviving as long as possible. After each wave you can upgrade your player. You can move using WASD and shoot using arrow keys. The project uses P5.js for graphics and Sockets.io for multiplayer. You can play the game<a href="essay.html">here</a></div>
  <h1 id="Research">Research Paper</h1>
  <div>One nonprogramming project I am proud of is a research paper on robotics. I wrote this for my final project in chemistry. It details the history of robotics and AI, it also documents recent advancements in robotics. You can read the paper <a href="essay.html">here</a></div>
  <h1 id="Tale">Tale Of Zol</h1>
  <img src="img/ZOL.PNG" alt="ZOL image">
  <div>Another project I have made is Tale of Zol, which is a Legend of Zelda like game. I created this as my final project in the 10th grade. Defeat the bosses to gain more health and defeat the evil wizard! It only uses Javascript, and all of the map data is in a array of objects. One issue is that the rooms are actually images so having a slow internet connection can have these take a while to load. You can move using WASD or arrows keys, and space bar attacks. You can play the game<a href="/Projects/ZOL/Index.html">here</a></div>
